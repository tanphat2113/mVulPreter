		 * can not call restore_reserve_on_error now as it would
		 * require holding mmap_sem.
		 *
		 * If a reservation for the page existed in the reservation
		 * map of a private mapping, the map was modified to indicate
		 * the reservation was consumed when the page was allocated.
		 * We clear the PagePrivate flag now so that the global
		 * reserve count will not be incremented in free_huge_page.
		 * The reservation map will still indicate the reservation
		 * was consumed and possibly prevent later page allocation.
		 * This is better than leaking a global reservation.  If no
		 * reservation existed, it is still safe to clear PagePrivate
		 * as no adjustments to reservation counts were made during
		 * allocation.
		 *
		 * The reservation map for shared mappings indicates which
		 * pages have reservations.  When a huge page is allocated
		 * for an address with a reservation, no change is made to
		 * the reserve map.  In this case PagePrivate will be set
		 * to indicate that the global reservation count should be
		 * incremented when the page is freed.  This is the desired
		 * behavior.  However, when a huge page is allocated for an
		 * address without a reservation a reservation entry is added
		 * to the reservation map, and PagePrivate will not be set.
		 * When the page is freed, the global reserve count will NOT
		 * be incremented and it will appear as though we have leaked
		 * reserved page.  In this case, set PagePrivate so that the
		 * global reserve count will be incremented to match the
		 * reservation map entry which was created.
		 *
		 * Note that vm_alloc_shared is based on the flags of the vma
		 * for which the page was originally allocated.  dst_vma could
		 * be different or NULL on error.
