# mVulPreter
We implement mVulPreter, a multi-granularity vulnerability detector that can provide interpretation of detection results. 
Specifically, we propose a novel technique to effectively blend the advantages of function-level and slice-level vulnerability detection models and output the detection results' interpretation only by the model itself. 

The dataset has been published here, and the source code will be made available after the paper is accepted.
